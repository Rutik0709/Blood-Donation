      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p class="intro">
        We are a dedicated platform focused on connecting life-saving blood donors with patients in urgent need.
        Our mission is to ensure that no life is lost due to the unavailability of blood. We believe in saving lives through action, awareness, and technology.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to bridge the gap between voluntary blood donors and seekers across the country. 
        By making the donation process more accessible and transparent, we help strengthen our healthcare system.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Blood Donation Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Every 2 seconds, someone needs blood. One unit of blood can save up to 3 lives. 
        Yet, countless lives are lost due to blood shortages. Your donation today could mean someone's tomorrow.
